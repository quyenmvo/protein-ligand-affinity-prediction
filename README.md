# protein-ligand-affinity-prediction
This project focuses on predicting the binding affinity between proteins and ligands using deep learning and deep kernel learning methods. The goal is to accelerate the drug discovery process by leveraging computational models to predict interactions, which is crucial in the context of emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19.
